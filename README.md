 ## Description
## **MyTechBlog: Blogging Platform**

### **Description:**

In the realm of technology and development, the ability to articulate and share technical knowledge is just as crucial as the skill to create the tech itself. Developers often spend countless hours building applications and rectifying errors in their code. But they also allocate a significant amount of time to learn from articles, tutorials, and think pieces, often written by their peers. Recognizing the vital role that content plays in the developer ecosystem, we introduce **MyTechBlog** - a CMS-style blog platform dedicated to developers.

### **Objective:**

The primary goal of MyTechBlog is to offer developers a space where they can share their experiences, insights, and tutorials, as well as comment on and engage with the content shared by their peers. Drawing inspiration from platforms like WordPress, MyTechBlog aims to simplify the process of publishing tech-focused content while maintaining a sense of community among its users.

### **Features:**

1. **MVC Paradigm**: The application's architecture follows the Model-View-Controller paradigm, ensuring separation of concerns and modular code.
  
2. **Handlebars.js**: Employed as the templating language, Handlebars.js allows for efficient and dynamic content rendering on the platform.
  
3. **Sequelize ORM**: Leveraging Sequelize, the application efficiently handles data modeling, retrieval, and other database operations.
  
4. **express-session**: The application uses the express-session npm package, ensuring user authentication is both secure and effective.
  
5. **User-generated Content**: Users can create, edit, and delete their posts. They can also read, comment on, and engage with posts written by other developers.

6. **Deployment**: The application is deployed on Heroku, making it easily accessible to users worldwide.

### **Why MyTechBlog?**

Just type a technical query on Google, and you're met with thousands of articles, each offering a different perspective or solution. Amidst this ocean of content, **MyTechBlog** strives to provide a platform where genuine, user-generated insights rise to the top, where every developer, irrespective of their skill level, can share and grow.

### **Getting Started:**

To use MyTechBlog, simply register an account, log in, and you're ready to publish your first post or dive into the vast collection of articles and tutorials shared by our community.

**Note to Developers:** We appreciate the effort developers put into both building technology and writing about it. MyTechBlog is our tribute to that dedication. Happy coding and happy writing!
